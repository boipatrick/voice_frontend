# Product Requirements Document: Voice Journal Frontend Implementation

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the remaining implementation tasks required to fully connect the Voice Journal frontend with the backend API. The API integration layer (api.ts) has been completed, but several frontend components need updating to utilize these API functions correctly.

## 2. Current State
- ✅ API Integration Layer (api.ts): Complete
- ❌ Upload Page (upload/+page.svelte): Needs integration with backend
- ❌ Transcribing Page (transcribing/+page.svelte): Needs real API integration instead of mock data
- ❌ Transcription View Page (/transcription/[id]/+page.svelte): Needs complete implementation
- ❌ History Page (history/+page.svelte): Needs to show real transcription history

## 3. Required Changes by Component

### 3.1 Upload Page (upload/+page.svelte)
**Required Changes:**
- Connect file upload form to the uploadAudio() API function
- Add proper loading states during upload
- Add error handling for failed uploads
- Redirect to transcription processing page with file ID upon successful upload

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can upload audio files of supported formats
- Upload progress is clearly indicated
- Errors are displayed meaningfully to the user
- Successful uploads redirect to transcription processing

### 3.2 Transcribing Page (transcribing/+page.svelte)
**Required Changes:**
- Extract file ID from URL parameters
- Call processTranscription() API function with the file ID
- Show realistic progress indication
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Redirect to transcription view page upon completion

**Success Criteria:**
- Page correctly processes audio file on load
- User receives visual feedback during processing
- Successful processing redirects to the transcription view

### 3.3 Transcription View Page (/transcription/[id]/+page.svelte)
**Required Changes:**
- Fetch transcription data using getTranscription() API function
- Display transcription text, summary, and segments
- Implement audio playback using getAudioUrl() function
- Add ability to delete transcription using deleteTranscription()
- Add download summary functionality using getSummaryDownloadUrl()
- Implement navigation back to history page

**Success Criteria:**
- Page correctly displays all transcription data
- Audio player works with the transcribed audio file
- Delete functionality works correctly
- Summary can be downloaded as text

### 3.4 History Page (history/+page.svelte)
**Required Changes:**
- Fetch all transcriptions using getAllTranscriptions() API function
- Display list of transcriptions with metadata (date, title, duration)
- Implement sorting/filtering of transcription list (optional)
- Add navigation to individual transcription pages
- Handle empty state and error state

**Success Criteria:**
- Page displays all available transcriptions
- Each entry links to its detailed view
- Empty and error states are handled gracefully

## 4. Implementation Priority
1. Upload Page - Start of user journey
2. Transcribing Page - Essential for processing
3. Transcription View - Core functionality display
4. History Page - Navigation and discovery

## 5. Testing Requirements
- Test all API interactions with both successful and error responses
- Test with various audio file types and sizes
- Verify responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Ensure loading states and error states are properly handled

## 6. Next Steps
1. Implement each component following the outlined requirements
2. Test each component individually
3. Test the complete flow from upload to viewing in history
4. Add any additional UX improvements (animations, transitions, etc.)
